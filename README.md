# DeepLearningProject
The following directories have to be updated by downloading the files from google drive repositories (check the link on each readMe):  
        - tfod
        - Labels  
        - Tensorflow/workspace/images  
        - Tensorflow/workspace/images_CGB  

To properly execute the code, initialize the tfod virtual environment with the command:

        ./tfod/Scripts/activate

And select tfod as the kernel of the Jupyter Notebook
